# JExamBot
Automatically enrolls you on TUD INF JExam. Just use your favorite IDE, add the src and add all .jar files in lib to your classpath. Edit the Main.java to your needs, add your wanted schedule and insert your user information (sNumber and password).

When there are multiple lessons of the same subject at the same time, you will need to add room information to that lesson. Please also make sure to always use the correct week. This is normally "WEEKLY", but can be "1_KW" or "2_KW" when there are 2 weeks between lessons.

Have fun, start enrolling and report bugs!
